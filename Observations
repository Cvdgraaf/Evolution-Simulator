For the first version, I am trying to increase the number of offsprings when an organism has a high fitness.
The program seems to give the expected result in general, but it seems like the population could be heavily affected by bad mutations that will still propagate.
Possible solutions: maybe try to make it more resistant to changes? (a clause could be harder to lose?) (tried to put more variables / clause)
